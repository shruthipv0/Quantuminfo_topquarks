# Entanglement Measurement in Top Quark Pair Production

This project explores the entanglement phenomena within top quark pairs, a critical aspect yet to be observed at the TeV energy scale achieved by hadron colliders. Investigating the entanglement between these fundamental particles, particularly within the top and anti-top pair final states, holds promise for unlocking new insights in quantum information studies.

## Abstract

he entanglement between fundamental particles has never been observed at the TeV energy reached by the hadron colliders. The top and anti-top pair are one of the most promising final states for this measurement. The top quarks are ideal for quantum infor- mation studies because their spin decorrelation and hadronisation time are shorter than their lifetime. This study measured the region of phase space, where the entanglement between two top quarks can be observed using a data set generated by Monte Carlo simulations. It also investigated the effect of entanglement between the tops when an associated Z-boson was produced. The tops were reconstructed to associate the correct decay products with each top quark. The angular distribution of the leptons in their parent top rest frame was used to measure the entanglement criteria, D. The D value had to be less than −31 for a selected sample to be entangled. The entanglement was only observed at threshold, which rendered a narrow top pair mass range where entanglement can be observed. Therefore, widening the invariant mass window, where the entanglement could be measured, would facilitate quantum information studies. Hence, selection cuts were made using the observables to increase the invariant mass window, where the tops are entangled. The D value at 400 GeV was reduced to -0.43,-0.41,-0.46 for xf , the num- ber of jets, and cosθ∗, respectively. These cuts effectively removed the events in which the tops were created by the quark and anti-quark annihilation, as they are not entangled. The cuts on cosθ∗ increased the invariant mass window to 600 GeV, where entanglement could be observed.
